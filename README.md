# Kentucky-Impaired-Waterways-and-Active-Mines
Final Project for MAP 671 

My mapping project was to explore the relationship between imparied waterways, priority watersheds, and active mines in Kentucky.

### Purpose

It would be irresponsible to say there is a direct link from mining activities and impaired waterways, but there is definitely correlation and mining activities can cause damage to ecosystems, especially aquatic ecosystems. I wanted to explore this topic because I work at the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet as an Environmental Scientist in the Division of Enforcement. I work with data like this everyday, but don't often have the time to pursue projects like this in my day to day duties.   


### Summary

Section 305(b) of the Clean Water Act requires states to assess the condition of the "Waters of the US." The Kentucky Division of Water collects biological and water quality data to assess the condition of waterways and reports this to Congress every two years in the [Integrated Report to Congress](https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Water/Monitor/Pages/IntegratedReportDownload.aspx) I used these data to explore waterways designated impaired in previous years and the new waterways added in the 2022 report.

Permits are required to mine and I focused on active producing mines. There are many mines in Kentucky that are no longer in production or in reclamation status and those can still be of concern ecologically, but I focused on the active ones, both surface and underground mines. In Kentucky, mining operations take place in the Western and Eastern coalfields, but production is limited to underground mines in Western Kentucky. Over the last 10 years, demand for coal from Kentucky has dropped considerably and the number one consumer of coal from Kentucky is Kentucky. The Office of Energy Policy produces [Coal Facts](https://eec.ky.gov/Energy/News-Publications/Pages/Coal-Facts.aspx#InplviewHasha2ae85ba-67cd-405f-8095-ed0c0a5de410=Paged%3DTRUE-p_SortBehavior%3D0-p_FileLeafRef%3D2020%252dQ1%252epdf-p_ID%3D31-PageFirstRow%3D31) reports on a quarterly and annual basis and contain statistics on coal employment and production. In Eastern Kentucky, Pike, Perry, and Harlan counties are the top producers, while in Western Kentucky, Union, Hopkins, and Muhlenberg couties are the top producers. In my analysis, these six counties had the most active mining operations and the largest areas of impaired waterways for counties with active mining operations. 

Using the Priority Watershed data helped to highlight areas of major concern around the Commonwealth. These areas helped to highlight overall areas within specific watersheds - which contains multiple waterways. I analyzed three specific areas Western Kentucky, Eastern Kentucky, and Central Kentucky. While there are no mining activities in Central Kentucky, there are several waterways that are impaired and multiple watersheds that are listed as priorities. The Kentucky Division of Water (DOW) Priority Watersheds represent watersheds where focus is placed for limited resources to improve water quality. This data helps drive the prioritization effort to address specific local water quality needs. These watersheds receive greater consideration for funding and technical support in regards to grants, water infrastructure projects, wastewater improvement, and in agricultural programs. Priorities reflect areas with a demonstrated need for investment, including impaired waters and environmental justice considerations, to improve water quality.
